	<blockquote>"Once I started working with generative music in the 1970s, I was flirting with ideas of making a kind of endless music â€” not like a record that you'd put on and which would play for a while and finish. I like the idea of a kind of eternal music, but I didn't want it to be eternally repetitive, either. I wanted it to be eternally changing."</blockquote>
