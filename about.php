	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Schema47 began as a self directed research group in 2015.

Taking an anti-disciplinary stance, we came together to develop frameworks, experiences and technologies which sit outside the traditional categories of art and science, to explore the nature of the world and our participation in it. In addition to our professional, creative and academic training, our discussions are informed by our unique lived experience and cultural backgrounds.

Through an ongoing collaboration we also hope to learn how scientists and artists can collaborate to enhance their own research projects and practices, questioning what kind of intellectual, practical and theoretical tools we can share.
